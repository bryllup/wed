* Getting started

/Note that this is very much a work in progress/

Always branch first and start a pull-request early. Only pull-requests
will be merged into master and that's also where all the discussion
happens. You can read more about this strategy at [[https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/][Github flow]]. In
order to keep a clean change-log, it's mandatory to read through and
grok [[http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][How to Write a Git Commit Message]].

OK, so:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
lein do garden once, figwheel dev
#+END_SRC

Executing that command will generate the necessary styles and launch a
server on your [[http://localhost:8080][localhost]].
